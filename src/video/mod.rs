//! Module to control the GBA's screen.
//!
//! # Video Basics
//!
//! To configure the screen's display, you should first decide on the
//! [`DisplayControl`] value that you want to set to the
//! [`DISPCNT`](crate::mmio::DISPCNT) register. This configures several things,
//! but most importantly it determines the [`VideoMode`] for the display to use.
//!
//! The GBA has four Background layers. Depending on the current video mode,
//! different background layers will be available for use in either "text",
//! "affine", or "bitmap" mode.
//!
//! In addition to the background layers, there's also an "OBJ" layer. This
//! allows the display of a number of "objects", which can move independently of
//! any background. Generally, one or more objects will be used to display the
//! "sprites" within a game. Because there isn't an exact 1:1 mapping between
//! sprites and objects, these docs will attempt to only talk about objects.
//!
//! ## Color, Bit Depth, and Palettes
//!
//! [Color] values on the GBA are 5-bits-per-channel RGB values. They're always
//! bit-packed and aligned to 2, so think of them as being like a `u16`.
//!
//! Because of the GBA's limited memory, most images don't use direct color (one
//! color per pixel). Instead they use indexed color (one *palette index* per
//! pixel). Indexed image data can be 4-bits-per-pixel (4bpp) or
//! 8-bits-per-pixel (8bpp). In either case, the color values themselves are
//! stored in the PALRAM region. The PALRAM contains the [`BG_PALETTE`] and
//! [`OBJ_PALETTE`], which hold the color values for backgrounds and objects
//! respectively. Both palettes have 256 slots. The palettes are always indexed
//! with 8 bits total, but *how* those bits are determined depends on the bit
//! depth of the image:
//! * Things drawing with 8bpp image data index into the full range of the
//!   palette directly.
//! * Things drawing with 4bpp image data will also have a "palbank" setting.
//!   The palbank acts as the upper 4 bits of the index, selecting which block
//!   of 16 palette entries the that thing will be able to use. Then each 4-bit
//!   pixel within the image indexes within the palbank.
//!
//! In both 8bpp and 4bpp modes, if a particular pixel's index value is 0 then
//! that pixel is instead considered transparent. So 8bpp images can use 255
//! colors (+ transparent), and 4bpp images can use 15 colors (+ transparent).
//! Each background layer and each object can individually be set to display
//! with either 4bpp or 8bpp mode.
//!
//! ## Tiles, Screenblocks, and Charblocks
//!
//! The basic unit of the GBA's hardware graphics support is a "tile".
//! Regardless of their bit depth, a tile is always an 8x8 area. This means that
//! they're either 32 bytes (4bpp) or 64 bytes (8bpp). Since VRAM starts aligned
//! to 4, and since both size tiles are a multiple of 4 bytes in size, we model
//! tile data as being arrays of `u32` rather than arrays of `u8`. Having the
//! data stay aligned to 4 within the ROM gives a significant speed gain when
//! copying tiles from ROM into VRAM.
//!
//! The layout of tiles within a background is defined by a "screenblock".
//! * Text backgrounds use a fixed 32x32 size screenblock, with larger
//!   backgrounds using more than one screenblock. Each [TextEntry] value in the
//!   screenblock has a tile index (10-bit), bits for horizontal flip and
//!   vertical flip, and a palbank value. If the background is not in 4bpp mode
//!   the palbank value is simply ignored.
//! * Affine backgrounds always have a single screenblock each, and the size of
//!   the screenblock itself changes with the background's size (from 16x16 to
//!   128x128, in powers of 2). Each entry in an affine screenblock is just a
//!   `u8` tile index, with no special options. Affine backgrounds can't use
//!   4bpp color, and they also can't flip tiles on a per-tile basis.
//!
//! A background's screenblock is selected by an index (5-bit). The indexes go
//! in 2,048 byte (2k) jumps. This is exactly the size of a text screenblock,
//! but doesn't precisely match the size of any of the affine screenblocks.
//!
//! Because tile indexes can only be so large, there are also "charblocks". This
//! offsets all of the tile index values that the background uses, allowing you
//! to make better use of all of the VRAM. The charblock value provides a 16,384
//! byte (16k) offset, and can be in the range `0..=3`.
//!
//! ## Priority
//!
//! When more than one thing would be drawn to the same pixel, there's a
//! priority system that determines which pixel is actually drawn.
//! * Priority values are always 2-bit, the range `0..=3`. The priority acts
//!   like the sorting index, or you could also think of it as the distance from
//!   the viewer. Things with a *lower* priority number are *closer* to the
//!   viewer, and so they'll be what's drawn.
//! * Objects always draw over top a same-priority background.
//! * Lower indexed objects get drawn when two objects have the same priority.
//! * Lower numbered backgrounds get drawn when two backgrounds have the same
//!   priority.
//!
//! There's also one hardware bug that can occur: when there's two objects and
//! their the priority and index wouldn't sort them the same (eg: a lower index
//! number object has a higher priority number), if a background is *also*
//! between the two objects, then the object that's supposed to be behind the
//! background will instead appear through the background where the two objects
//! overlap. This might never happen to you, but if it does, the "fix" is to
//! sort your object entries so that any lower priority objects are also the
//! lower index objects.
