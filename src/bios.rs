//! This module contains wrappers for all GBA BIOS function calls.
//!
//! A GBA BIOS call has significantly more overhead than a normal function call,
//! so think carefully before using them too much.
//!
//! The actual content of each function here is generally a single inline asm
//! instruction to invoke the correct BIOS function (`swi x`, with `x` being
//! whatever value is necessary for that function). Some functions also perform
//! necessary checks to save you from yourself, such as not dividing by zero.

///
/// Instead, it clears the top `0x200` bytes of IWRAM (containing stacks, and
/// BIOS IRQ vector/flags), re-initializes the system, supervisor, and irq stack
/// pointers (new values listed below), sets `r0` through `r12`, `LR_svc`,
/// `SPSR_svc`, `LR_irq`, and `SPSR_irq` to zero, and enters system mode. The
/// return address is loaded into `r14` and then the function jumps there with
/// `bx r14`.
///
/// * sp_svc: `0x300_7FE0`
/// * sp_irq: `0x300_7FA0`
/// * sp_sys: `0x300_7F00`
/// * Zero-filled Area: `0x300_7E00` to `0x300_7FFF`
/// * Return Address: Depends on the 8-bit flag value at `0x300_7FFA`. In either
///   case execution proceeds in ARM mode.
///   * zero flag: `0x800_0000` (ROM), which for our builds means that the
///     `crt0` program to execute (just like with a fresh boot), and then
///     control passes into `main` and so on.
///   * non-zero flag: `0x200_0000` (RAM), This is where a multiboot image would
///     go if you were doing a multiboot thing. However, this project doesn't
///     support multiboot at the moment. You'd need an entirely different build
