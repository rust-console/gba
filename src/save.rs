//! Module for reading and writing to save media.
//!
//! This module provides both specific interfaces that directly access particular
//! types of save media, and an abstraction layer that allows access to all kinds
//! of save media using a shared interface.
//!
//! ## Save media types
//!
//! There are, broadly speaking, three different kinds of save media that can be
//! found in official Game Carts:
//!
//! * Battery-Backed SRAM: The simplest kind of save media, which can be accessed
//!   like normal memory. You can have SRAM up to 32KiB, and while there exist a
//!   few variants this does not matter much for a game developer.
//! * EEPROM: A kind of save media based on very cheap chips and slow chips.
//!   These are accessed using a serial interface based on reading/writing bit
//!   streams into IO registers. This memory comes in 8KiB and 512 byte versions,
//!   which unfortunately cannot be distinguished at runtime.
//! * Flash: A kind of save media based on flash memory. Flash memory can be read
//!   like ordinary memory, but writing requires sending commands using multiple
//!   IO register spread across the address space. This memory comes in 64KiB
//!   and 128KiB variants, which can thankfully be distinguished using a chip ID.
//!
//! As these various types of save media cannot be easily distinguished at
//! runtime, the kind of media in use should be set manually.
//!
//! ## Setting save media type
//!
//! To use save media in your game, you must set which type to use. This is done
//! by calling one of the following functions at startup:
//!
//! * For 32 KiB battery-backed SRAM, call [`use_sram`].
//! * For 64 KiB flash memory, call [`use_flash_64k`].
//! * For 128 KiB flash memory, call [`use_flash_128k`].
//! * For 512 byte EEPROM, call [`use_eeprom_512b`].
//! * For 8 KiB EEPROM, call [`use_eeprom_8k`].
//!
//! Then, call [`set_timer_for_timeout`] to set the timer you intend to use to
//! track the timeout that prevents errors with the save media from hanging your
//! game. For more information on GBA timers, see the
//! [`timers`](`crate::io::timers`) module's documentation.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use gba::save;
//! save::use_flash_128k();
//! save::set_timer_for_timeout(3); // Uses timer 3 for save media timeouts.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Using save media
//!
//! To access save media, use the [`SaveAccess::new`] method to create a new
//! [`SaveAccess`] object. Its methods are used to read or write save media.
//!
//! Reading data from the savegame is simple. Use [`read`](`SaveAccess::read`)
//! to copy data from an offset in the savegame into a buffer in memory.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use gba::{info, save::SaveAccess};
//! let mut buf = [0; 1000];
//! SaveAccess::new()?.read(1000, &mut buf)?;
//! info!("Memory result: {:?}", buf);
//! ```
//!
//! Writing to save media requires you to prepare the area for writing by calling
//! the [`prepare_write`](`SaveAccess::prepare_write`) method before doing the
//! actual write commands with the [`write`](`SaveAccess::write`) method.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use gba::{info, save::SaveAccess};
//! let access = SaveAccess::new()?;
//! access.prepare_write(500..600)?;
//! access.write(500, &[10; 25])?;
//! access.write(525, &[20; 25])?;
//! access.write(550, &[30; 25])?;
//! access.write(575, &[40; 25])?;
//! ```
//!
//! The `prepare_write` method leaves everything in a sector that overlaps the
//! range passed to it in an implementation defined state. On some devices it may
//! do nothing, and on others, it may clear the entire range to `0xFF`.
//!
//! Because writes can only be prepared on a per-sector basis, a clear on a range
//! of `4000..5000` on a device with 4096 byte sectors will actually clear a range
//! of `0..8192`. Use [`sector_size`](`SaveAccess::sector_size`) to find the
//! sector size, or [`align_range`](`SaveAccess::align_range`) to directly
//! calculate the range of memory that will be affected by the clear.
//!
//! ## Performance and Other Details
//!
//! Because `prepare_write` does nothing on non-flash chips, it would not cause
//! correctness issues to ignore it. Even so, it is recommend to write code to
//! use the `prepare_write` function regardless of the save media, as it has
//! minimal runtime cost on other save media types. If needed, you can check if
//! `prepare_write` is required by calling the
//! (`requires_prepare_write`)(`SaveAccess::requires_prepare_write`) method.
//!
//! Some memory types have a `sector_size` above `1`, but do not use
//! `prepare_write`. This indicates that the media type has sectors that must
//! be rewritten all at once, instead of supporting the separate erase/write
//! cycles that flash media does. Writing non-sector aligned memory will be
//! slower on such save media, as the implementation needs to read the old
//! contents into a buffer before writing to avoid data loss.
//!
//! To summarize, for all supported media types:
//!
//! * SRAM does not require `prepare_write` and has no sectors to align to. Reads
//!   and writes at any alignment are efficient. Furthermore, it does not require
//!   a timer to be set with [`set_timer_for_timeout`].
//! * Non-Atmel flash chips requires `prepare_write`, and have sectors of 4096
//!   bytes. Atmel flash chips instead do not require `prepare_write`, and instead
//!   have sectors of 128 bytes. You should generally try to use `prepare_write`
//!   regardless, and write in blocks of 128 bytes if at all possible.
//! * EEPROM does not require `prepare_write` and has sectors of 8 bytes.
