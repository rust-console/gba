#![no_std]
#![feature(asm, global_asm, isa_attribute)]

//! This crate helps you write GBA ROMs.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! This crate takes *minimal* precautions to avoid GBA specific code from being
//! run on a standard desktop by accident by using `#[cfg(target_arch = "arm")]`
//! in appropriate places. However, there are obviously many other ARM devices
//! in the world. If you actually run the GBA specific code on something that
//! isn't a GBA, then that's your fault.
//!
//! ## Docs.rs
//!
//! The docs on docs.rs are generated for the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target
//! because the docs.rs docker image isn't currently able to use the
//! `-Zbuild-std=core` ability of cargo. Instead, we have it just build using a
//! "close enough" Tier 2 target.
//!
//! When building your actual GBA games you should of course use the
//! `thumbv4t-none-eabi` target.
