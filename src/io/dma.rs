//! Module for using the four Direct Memory Access (DMA) units.
//!
//! The GBA has four DMA units, numbered 0 through 3. If you ever try to have
//! more than one active at once the lowest numbered DMA will take priority and
//! complete first. Any use of DMA halts the CPU's operation. DMA can also be
//! configured to activate automatically at certain times, and when configured
//! like that the CPU runs in between the automatic DMA activations. (This is
//! actually the intended method for doing sound.) Each DMA unit has an intended
//! use:
//!
//! * DMA0: highest priority, but can only read from internal memory.
//! * DMA1/DMA2: Intended for sound transfers.
//! * DMA3: Can be used to write into Game Pak ROM / FlashROM (not SRAM).
//!
//! ## DMA Anatomy
//!
//! Each DMA is utilized via a combination four IO registers:
//!
//! * **Source Address:** (`*const u32`) Where to read from. DMA0 can only read
//!   from internal memory, the other units can read from any non-SRAM memory.
//! * **Destination Address:** (`*mut u32`) Where to write to. DMA0/1/2 can only
//!   write to internal memory, DMA3 can write to any non-SRAM memory.
//! * **Word Count:** (`u16`) How many units to transfer. Despite being called
//!   "word count" you can also use DMA to transfer half-words. DMA0/1/2 are
//!   limited to a 14-bit counter value, DMA3 allowed the full 16-bit range to
//!   be used for the counter. Note that even when transferring half-words you
//!   MUST have both Source and Destination be 32-bit aligned.
//! * **Control:** (`DMAControlSetting`) This is one of those fiddly bit-flag
//!   registers with all sorts of settings. See the type for more info.
//!
//! Note that Source, Destination, and Count are all read-only, while the
//! Control is read/write. When a DMA unit is _Enabled_ it copies the relevent
//! Source, Destination, and Count values into its own internal registers (so a
//! second Enable will reuse the old values). If the DMA _Repeats_ it re-copies
//! the Count, and also the Destination if
//! `DMADestAddressControl::IncrementReload` is configured in the Control, but
//! not the Source.
//!
//! When the DMA completes the Enable bit will be cleared from the Control,
//! unless the Repeat bit is set in the Control, in which case the Enable bit is
//! left active and the DMA will automatically activate again at the right time
//! (depending on the Start Timing setting). You have to manually turn off the
//! correct bit to stop the DMA unit.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! As you might have noticed by now, utilizing DMA can be very fiddly. It moves
//! around bytes with no concern for the type system, including the `Clone` and
//! `Copy` traits that Rust relies on. Use of DMA can be made _somewhat safe_
//! via wrapper methods (such as those we've provided), but it's fundamentally
//! an unsafe thing to use.
//!
//! ## DMA Can Cause Subtle Bugs
//!
//! Since the CPU is halted while DMA is active you can miss out on interrupts
//! that should have fired. This can cause any number of unintended effects. DMA
//! is primarily intended for loading large amounts of graphical data from ROM,
//! or loading sound data at regulated intervals to avoid pops and crackles. It
//! _can_ be used for general purpose bulk transfers but you are advised to use
//! restraint.
