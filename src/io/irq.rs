//! Module containing a wrapper for interrupt request (IRQ) handling.
//!
//! When an interrupt is executed, the CPU will be set to IRQ mode and code
//! execution will jump to the physical interrupt vector, located in BIOS. The
//! BIOS interrupt handler will then save several registers to the IRQ stack
//! pointer and execution will jump to the user interrupt handler starting at
//! `0x0300_7FFC`, in ARM mode.
//!
//! Currently, the user interrupt handler is defined in `rsrt0.S`. It is set up
//! to execute a user-specified interrupt handler after saving some registers.
//! This handler is declared as a static function pointer on the Rust side, and
//! can be set by using [`set_irq_handler`](irq::set_irq_handler).
//!
//! ## Notes
//! * The interrupt will only be triggered if [`IME`](irq::IME) is enabled, the
//!   flag corresponding to the interrupt is enabled on the [`IE`](irq::IE)
//!   register, and the "IRQ Enable" flag is set on the register related to the
//!   interrupt, which varies. For example, to enable interrupts on VBlank you
//!   would set the
//!   [`vblank_irq_enable`](io::display::DisplayStatusSetting::vblank_irq_enable)
//!   flag on the [`DISPSTAT`](io::display::DISPCNT) register.
//! * If you intend to use [`interrupt_wait`](bios::interrupt_wait) or
//!   [`vblank_interrupt_wait`](bios::vblank_interrupt_wait) to wait for an
//!   interrupt, your interrupt handler MUST update the BIOS Interrupt Flags at
//!   [`BIOS_IF`](irq::BIOS_IF) in addition to the usual interrupt
//!   acknowledgement (which is handled for you by the user interrupt handler).
//!   This is done by setting the corresponding IRQ flag on
//!   [`BIOS_IF`](irq::BIOS_IF) at the end of the interrupt handler.
//! * You can change the low-level details of the interrupt handler by editing
//!   the `MainIrqHandler` routine in `rsrt0.S`. For example, you could declare
//!   an external static variable in Rust holding a table of interrupt function
//!   pointers and jump directly into one of them in assembly, without the need
//!   to write the branching logic in Rust. However, note that the main
//!   interrupt handler MUST acknowledge all interrupts received by setting
//!   their corresponding bits to `1` in the [`IF`](irq::IF) register.
//! * If you wait on one or more interrupts, be sure at least one of them is
//!   able to be triggered or the call to wait will never return.
//! * If you wait on multiple interrupts and those interrupts fire too quickly,
//!   it is possible that the call to wait will never return as interrupts will
//!   be constantly received before control is returned to the caller. This
//!   usually only happens when waiting on multiple timer interrupts with very
//!   fast overflow rates.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern "C" fn irq_handler(flags: IrqFlags) {
//!   if flags.vblank() {
//!     // Run drawing logic here.
//!
//!     // Acknowledge the IRQ on the BIOS Interrupt Flags register.
//!     BIOS_IF.write(BIOS_IF.read().with_vblank(true));
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! fn main_loop() {
//!   // Set the IRQ handler to use.
//!   irq::set_irq_handler(irq_handler);
//!
//!   // Handle only the VBlank interrupt.
//!   const FLAGS: IrqFlags = IrqFlags::new().with_vblank(true);
//!   IE.write(flags);
//!
//!   // Enable all interrupts that are set in the IE register.
//!   IME.write(IrqEnableSetting::UseIE);
//!
//!   // Enable IRQ generation during VBlank.
//!   const DISPLAY_SETTINGS: DisplayStatusSetting = DisplayStatusSetting::new()
//!     .with_vblank_irq_enable(true);
//!   DISPSTAT.write(DISPLAY_SETTINGS);
//!
//!   loop {
//!     // Sleep the CPU until a VBlank IRQ is generated.
//!     bios::vblank_interrupt_wait();
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! This is the setup the provided user interrupt handler in `rsrt0.S` will do
//! when an interrupt is received, in order. It is based on the _Recommended
//! User Interrupt Handling_ portion of the GBATEK reference.
//!
//! 1. Save the status of [`IME`](irq::IME).
//! 2. Save the IRQ stack pointer and change to system mode to use the user
//!    stack instead of the IRQ stack (to prevent stack overflow).
//! 3. Disable interrupts by setting [`IME`](irq::IME) to 0, so other interrupts
//!    will not preempt the main interrupt handler.
//! 4. Acknowledge all IRQs that occurred and were enabled in the
//!    [`IE`](irq::IE) register by writing the bits to the [`IF`](irq::IF)
//!    register.
//! 5. Save the user stack pointer, switch to Thumb mode and jump to the
//!    user-specified interrupt handler. The IRQ flags that were set are passed
//!    as an argument in `r0`.
//! 6. When the handler returns, restore the user stack pointer and switch back
//!    to IRQ mode.
//! 7. Restore the IRQ stack pointer and the status of [`IME`](irq::IME).
//! 8. Return to the BIOS interrupt handler.
