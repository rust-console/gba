# gba

A crate that helps you make GBA games

# First Time Setup

This crate requires a fair amount of special setup. All of the steps are
detailed for you [in the 0th chapter of the
book](https://rust-console.github.io/gba/00-introduction/03-development-setup.html) that goes with this
crate.

If you've done the global setup once before and just want to get a new project
started quickly we got you covered:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-console/gba/master/init.sh -sSf | bash -s APP_NAME
```
