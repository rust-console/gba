# gba

A crate to make GBA programming easy.

Currently we don't have as much documentation as we'd like.
If you check out the [awesome-gbadev](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbadev) repository they have many resources, though most are oriented towards C.

## First Time Setup

Building for the GBA requires Nightly rust, and also uses the `build-std` feature, so you'll need the rust source available.

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup +nightly component add rust-src
```

You'll also need the ARM binutils so that you can have the assembler and linker for the ARMv4T architecture.
The way to get them varies by platform:
* Ubuntu and other debian-like linux distros will usually have them in the package manager.
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install binutils-arm-none-eabi
  ```
* With OSX you can get them via homebrew.
  ```shell
  brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded
  ```
* On Windows you can get the installer from ARM's website and run that.
  * Download the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
  * When installing the toolchain, make sure to select "Add path to environment variable" during install.
  * You'll have to restart any open command prompts after you so run the installer so that they see the new PATH value.

Finally, rustc itself is only able to make ELF format files. These can be run in emulators, but aren't able to be played on actual hardware.
You'll need to convert the ELF file into a GBA rom. There's a `cargo-make` file in this repository to do this, and it relies on a tool called `gbafix`
to assign the right header data to the ROM when packing it.

```sh
cargo install cargo-make
cargo install gbafix
```

<!--
## First Time Setup

Writing a Rust program for the GBA requires a fair amount of special setup. All
of the steps are detailed for you in the [Development
Setup](https://rust-console.github.io/gba/development-setup.html) part at the
start of the book.

If you've done the described global setup once before and just want to get a new
project started quickly we got you covered:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-console/gba/master/init.sh -sSf | bash -s APP_NAME
```
